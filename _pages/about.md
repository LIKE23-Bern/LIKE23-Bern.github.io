LIKE23 is a research school and workshop that will take place between June 26th and 30th 2023, with main topics

  *  kernel embeddings from theory to applications,   

  *  recent advances in Gaussian Process modelling,  

  *  active learning for accelerated inference. 

More details will follow soon, including the [program](/program) and the complete schedule.
